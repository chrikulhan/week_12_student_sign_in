What should happen when Add button in NewStudentForm is pressed?

-The NewStudentForm component should emit message to parent
    - in this project, that's App.vue
-NewStudentForm's job is to show a form, get input, validate
    â€“ it doesn't care what happens to the new student once it's created

-Parent component (App.vue) will keep list of students
-Parent component will provide list to StudentTable component

***Problem - we shouldn't modify props***
-Using v-model student.present changes data in the student array
-We should avoid this - bad practice to modify props
-Child components should not change data in their parents - they should only communicate via events
  "data down, events up"

***"Data down, events up" (week 10, slide 86)
-StudentTable receives students as a prop
-StudentTable diplays data in template
-When user checks checkbox (we want to remove the v-model) We want StudentTable to emit an event to parent
with student info, and state of checkbox- checked or unchecked.
-App.vue receives the event (ex. a specific student has arrived) and updates (modifies its data) student data
    *App.vue will:
        -find the student in the array,
        -update whether or not they are present

-App.vue doesn't have to do anything else as the data is reactive:
-Because student data is reactive, and bound to the student prop in StudentTable,
then info will flow back to StudentTable sees the updates, AND the template will then update.
