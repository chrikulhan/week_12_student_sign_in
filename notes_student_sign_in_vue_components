What should happen when Add button in NewStudentForm is pressed?

-The NewStudentForm component should emit message to parent
    - in this project, that's App.vue
-NewStudentForm's job is to show a form, get input, validate
    â€“ it doesn't care what happens to the new student once it's created

-Parent component (App.vue) will keep list of students
-Parent component will provide list to StudentTable component
